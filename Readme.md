# Discrete Q-Learning Agent in a 5x5 grid world.

This is an example of a discrete Q-Learning agent in a 5x5 grid world, using bellman updates to converge on the optimum path over a set number of epochs.

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in the project root directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/chrispukas/Discrete_Q-Learning_Grid-World.git
pip install .
```

Then, for the agent, open ```./notebooks/main.ipynb```
